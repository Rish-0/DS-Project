            <h1>What is a Symptom?</h1>
            <p>A symptom is something felt or experienced, such as pain or dizziness. Signs and symptoms are not
                mutually exclusive, for example a subjective feeling of fever can be noted as sign by using a
                thermometer that registers a high reading. The CDC lists various diseases by their signs and
                symptoms such as for measles which includes a high fever, conjunctivitis, and cough, followed a few days
                later by the measles rash.

            <h1>How age affects transmission of diseases?</h1>
            <p>Age affects disease transmission through immune system differences, behavior, and exposure risks.
                Children have weaker immunity, poor hygiene, and frequent contact, increasing spread. Young adults
                engage in social interactions that can heighten transmission. The elderly have weakened immunity and are
                more vulnerable to infections, especially in healthcare settings. Vaccination effectiveness also varies
                by age, impacting disease control.</p>
